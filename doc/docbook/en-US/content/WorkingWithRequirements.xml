    <title>Working with Requirements</title>

    <para>This chapter shows you how to create a project and add requirements
    to it. Requel doesn’t impose any particular process for creating
    requirements, which makes it flexible, but the flexibility may make it
    harder for you to get started if you don’t have a process for gathering
    requirements in mind. If you don’t have a process in mind, you may want to
    start with stories to describe the behavior of the system.</para>

    <para>In any case, to start you will need to create a project and the
    stakeholders that will work on the requirements.</para>
