        <title>What is Requel?</title>

      <para>Requel is a requirements engineering system that supports
      collaboration among business and technical stakeholders and provides
      automated assistance to validate requirements and suggest
      improvements.</para>

      <para>It is a Web-based application to facilitate a distributed team of
      users. It supports collaboration with a semi-structured discussion and
      negotiation mechanism. It assists users by applying natural language
      processing to the requirements to detect and report ambiguity and
      complexity. It identifies potential significant terms in the
      requirements to assist in build a glossary and making the requirements
      more understandable and consistent.</para>
