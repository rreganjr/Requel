            <text>Buddy the controller of Bailey Pet Supply has a problem; it takes over a month to close the books each quarter. Due to new disclosure requirements, Alex the CFO needs to submit quarterly results to the board of directors one week after the end of the quarter. Buddy tells Theresa, the accounting manager, that they need to close the books each quarter in less than a week. Theresa tells Buddy that the problem stems from the order processing system not being integrated with the accounting package and at the end of each month data must be entered into both systems to reconcile them manually.
Buddy decides that the systems must be integrated before the end of the next quarter so that the one week turn-around for reporting can be met. Buddy meets with Dave the IT manager to discuss the work. Dave assigns Tim, one of the IT project managers, to work with Buddy to determine the requirements and estimate the work. Tim meets with Buddy and they generate a list of high level requirements. Tim gives the requirements and a rough estimate of two months to Dave, who in turn gives them to Ron, an MIS programmer, to design and develop. Ron reviews the requirements and goes back to Dave and tells him there are a lot of vague areas and he needs to get clarification from Tim and Buddy.
Ron and Tim have a meeting to discuss the requirements. Ron asks Tim “What is a purchase order?” Tim response “It’s a record in the purchase system that Linda enters based on information from a sales person.” Ron asks “What information is in the purchase order?” Tim doesn’t know and tells Ron he will ask Buddy and get back to him. Tim sends an email to Buddy and calls it a day.
Buddy replies to Tim’s email that he should talk to Linda to get the details of a purchase order. Tim has a meeting with Linda and gets the details on the data for a purchase order. Tim sends Ron an email with the information. Ron replies to Tim’s email “Is there a database with data that I can look at for a sample?”

            <text>Theresa connects to the Requel system via a web browser from a link in an email message sent by the Requel system when Dave the system administrator created an account for her. The system displays the new user setup interface, prompting Theresa to confirm the personal information Dave entered about her and filling in any missing information, such as name, phone number, email address, a username and a password. When Theresa completes entering the information the system forwards her to the login screen.

Theresa enters her username and password, and the system verifies it as correct. The system logs that Theresa has successfully logged into the system, and because Theresa is a novice user, the system displays the novice user interface to help her get started.</text>
